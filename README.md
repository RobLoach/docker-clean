# Docker Clean

Cleans all local Docker containers and images.

Having all the Docker images and containers stored on your local file system can sometimes take up a lot of file space. This script will clear all of Docker's cached containers and images.


## Usage

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobLoach/docker-clean/master/docker-clean.sh
chmod +x docker-clean.sh
./docker-clean.sh
```

## Warning

This will permanently delete all saved containers and images. *Use at your own risk.*
